Appalachian State University Department of Computer Science S-STEM project Fall 2019


## Project Overview

This project is an attempt at recreating the tabletop game Tsuro within Java. The goal is to have a workable game that may be played by either humans, AI, or both. 

Eventually the goal is to incorporate some fundamental AI that will also be able to play the game with some level of insight. Further work may be done on this in the future.
